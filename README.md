The goal is to implement a REST- Interface using C# and .NET. The following requirements have to be met:
- It should be possible to manage people and their favorite colors over the interface
- The data should be read from a CSV file without the need to customize the CSV itself All people with specific favorite color can be determined over the interface


#### Example for the CSV file:

```
Müller, Hans, 67742 Lauterecken, 1
Petersen, Peter, 18439 Stralsund, 2
Johnson, Johnny, 88888 made up, 3
Millenium, Milly, 77777 made up too, 4 
Müller, Jonas, 32323 Hansstadt, 5 
Fujitsu, Tastatur, 42342 Japan, 6 
Andersson, Anders, 32132 Schweden - Bonus, 2 
Bart, Bertram, 12313 Wasweißich, 1 
Gerber, Gerda, 76535 Woanders, 3 
Klaussen, Klaus, 43246 Hierach, 2
```

#### The numbers of the fourth column should match the following colors:

1.	blue
2.	green
3.	purple
4.	red
5.	yellow
6.	turquois
7.	white

The format to return the data should match the following (Content-Type: application/json)


## The implemented REST- Interface should include the following methods:

### 1. Method to get all available users from the CSV
*GET /persons*

Return Example:

```
[{
"id" : 1,
"name" : "Hans",
"lastname": "Müller",
"zipcode" : "67742",
"city" : "Lauterecken",
"color" : "blue"
},
{
"id" : 2,
...
}]
```

### 2. Method to get the person with the given ID from the CSV file.
*GET /persons/{id}*

Since the file does not include an ID, the appropriate line number is relevant (first line – line 0).
Example: id 1 - Petersen, Peter, 18439 Stralsund, blue ;
in case there is no person with this exact id, a suitable Http status code needs to be used.

Return example:
```
{"id" : 1,
"name" : "Hans",
"lastname": "Müller",
"zipcode" : "67742",
"city" : "Lauterecken",
"color" : "blue"}
```

### 3. Method to get all people with the same favorite color. The color accordingly needs to be coded.
*GET /persons/color/{color}*

Return example:
```
[{
"id" : 1,
"name" : "Hans",
"lastname": "Müller",
"zipcode" : "67742",
"city" : "Lauterecken",
"color" : "blue"
},
{
"id" : 2,
...
}]
```

## Tasks:

-	[x] Read the CSV file and cache in a Json fitting model class (needs to be implemented). Ideally this should happen in a class, that abstracts the access to the file, thus this could be replaced through a simple database.
- [x]	Implement the given REST- interface. The interface accesses the persistence class via Dependency Injection.
- [ ] Write fitting unit tests for the interface (e.g. GetUsersWithColorTest(), GetAllUsersTest())

## Bonus:

- [ ] Implementation as a MSBuild project for continuous integration on TFS
- [x] Implement an additional method POST /persons which adds a new record to the CSV file 
- [x] Entity Framework- connection to a SQL database to persist the data
